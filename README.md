### Microservices practise 
- One command to build all services 
```
./gradlew build
``` 

- After build completion
	- make sure that you have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine
	- and make sure that you have enough resources to run all services
    - type in your terminal ```docker-compose up``` and docker compose will take of the rest

- You can view the api docs on ```http://localhost:8080/openapi/swagger-ui.html```
